# migrations

Sanity migrations using the API.

## Files

### `footerLinks.js` _(do not run)_

A simple document patch to illustrate how to set objects, and because adam
thought re-learning how to do this with code was prefereable to entering a
handful of links and slugs into the cms.

### `siteDataId` _(do not run)_

Update the primary site data entry such that it has a known id. There should
only be one entry for this data, but sanity might make others of the same type
as part of its revision system, so we should know its exact id.
